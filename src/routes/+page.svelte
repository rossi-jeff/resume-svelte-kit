	<div class="mb-4">
		My name is Jeff Rossi and my background is in writing code, in various languages. In my early
		career from ’98 to ’09 I worked with PHP and MySQL making interactive websites for clients as
		part of my solo web development company Data Driven Design. During this time, I was an active
		member in local Chamber of Commerce. Through the Chamber network I transitioned to a position at
		Asset Motion and focused on Ruby on Rails expand maintain the GPS tracking application.

	<div class="mb-4">
		Through Numerex, the company that hosted and produced the base application that I started with,
		I was connected with InTouch GPS, with whom I worked for a decade. About seven years into my
		tenure at In Touch the company merged with GPS Trackit who produced another similar GPS tracking
		application. I switched to one of the teams at GPS Trackit and started to work on the admin
		portion of next generation application. This application was written in NodeJS and hosted in
		Amazon Web Services. My team was in California, so I offset my shift to better collaborate with
		the team in Pacific Standard Time. When Covid 19 arrived it hit the trucking industry hard,
		which was our main clientele. As a result, I was downsized in April of 2020.

	<div class="mb-4">
		During the pandemic I determined the best course of action was to pursue a Bachelor of Science
		in Information Technology. The academic environment has prepared me for the next adventure in my
		career path.

	<h2 class="text-xl text-three font-bold mb-2">About This Site</h2>

	<div class="mb-4">
		This website is what is commonly called a full stack application. This indicates that the site
		is composed of two parts, a client user interface that presents the information, and a server or
		API that retrieves the information from a database. While there may not be enough information to
		warrant such construction methods the point is to display my capability to do so.
	</div>

	<div class="mb-4">
		There are two commonly used API technologies, REST (REpresentational State Transfer) and
		GraphQL. GraphQL is used for the various items throughout the site such as schools, jobs, and
		references.
	</div>

	<div class="mb-4">
		There are four UI applications using the popular frameworks of Angular, React, Vue, and Svelte.
		Links to the other applications are available on the Links page. This particular site was
		contructed using Svelte Kit. The source code to any of my applications is available upon
		request.
